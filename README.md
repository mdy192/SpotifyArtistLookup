# SpotifyArtistLookup
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will look up the top 10 songs of the nearest Spotify creator/artist in the search results
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose = First GitHub project + Learn how APIs work

Personal Development = I got to learn how APIs work and how the APIs call for information, and I saw firsthand how information was constructed and sent back to the program.

Future Changes = Would like to add the option for the user to select how many songs they would want to be sent back and listed, and in the future, work with the OpenAuth of Spotify and allow a user to log in and use the code to create a playlist directly from a creator search.
